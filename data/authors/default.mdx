A computer science graduate student striving to build impactful, scalable, and innovative solutions through technology.

Currently, I am pursuing my master's at Arizona State University, with a focus on backend development, system design, and distributed database systems.

Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer, contributing to projects involving payment gateway integrations with Stripe, log aggregation systems, and scaling infrastructure for high-performance applications. I’ve also designed fault-tolerant systems with a strong emphasis on business impact and reliability.

In my career, I’ve successfully collaborated with diverse teams to solve intricate technical challenges, from optimizing cross-functional workflows to implementing innovative solutions for real-time data processing.

Outside of academics, I enjoy diving into algorithmic problem-solving, exploring cutting-edge technologies, and sharing insights on efficient system designs.
